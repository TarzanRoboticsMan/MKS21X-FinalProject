  I wrote the basic code for the Node class in which we will store our words and their previous words to maintain their "path". I also downloaded a word list text file to use as our dictionary. I wrote the constructor for the dictionary class, creating the ArrayList of words based off of code Coby wrote earlier and then wrote the code to develop the table of contents, allowing us to more quickly access words based off of their first letter so we don't have to loop through the entire file everytime.

Coby, 1/4:
  Wrote prototype dictionary and scanner in WordLadder.java to test scanning through words. Spent a bunch of time studying javadocs for scanner and patterns

  Didn't do a lot today, mostly tried to figure out how to get lanterna and the TerminalDemo provided in class to work on windows, finally got it to work thanks to Ethan Morgan who helped a lot by providing the other version of lanterna and a rewritten form of TerminalDemo.java. Then just edited Dictionary.java to fix the code that created the table of contents and fixed a typo in wordLadder.
