  I wrote the basic code for the Node class in which we will store our words and their previous words to maintain their "path". I also downloaded a word list text file to use as our dictionary. I wrote the constructor for the dictionary class, creating the ArrayList of words based off of code Coby wrote earlier and then wrote the code to develop the table of contents, allowing us to more quickly access words based off of their first letter so we don't have to loop through the entire file everytime.
